**IMPORTANT** Pillow python library is needed to run the code!

By default, there is a sample pdf file to be encoded and some sample images, so you can
run the code without the need to do anything.

IF NEEDED, you can specify the path of the file that you want to be encoded in the "filepath" variable
and include some images in the "pics" folder in order to encode the file in the images.
