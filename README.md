# Steganography
Hide 
Pillow python library is needed to run the code!

In order to use the code, make sure to change the "filepath" variable to a file you would like to hide (by default the code will attempt to hide a pdf file).
Also, you can change the directory of images to use by changing the "pics_dir" variable to another directory that has images (these are the images that will be used to hide the data inside).
If you want to hide large files, you have to provide more/bigger pictures so that there are enough pixels to hide data inside.

Enjoy :)
